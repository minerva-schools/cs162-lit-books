    <h1>About Paper Trail</h1>

    <br>
    <h2>What's Paper Trail? ü§ì</h2>
    <h7> At Paper Trail, we want to transform your reading experience into a social adventure. Share a book with a friend, and follow its journey, one letter at a time. Before you put your favourite novella into the wild, share a note for readers to come: did the book challenge you, comfort you, or simply make you laugh? Here, we believe that the books we read shape our lives, and that your experience is valuable. Pass it on.  


    The idea of "six degrees of separation" says that each person is only six, or fewer, social connections away from one another. Who are you six degrees away from? Find out with Paper Trail.

      share a book and get a Book ID, please click "Share a Book" on your profile. </h3>
