# Paper Trial

### About
Paper trail is a book sharing and tracking service. We challenge you to explore six degrees of connection through a book. 

### What is the challenge like?
Share a book with your friend through Paper Trail. 
Challenge your friend to read and share the book to one of their connections. Repeat the process until you get to the six degrees of connection. Paper Trail will help you to track your book and collect thoughts along the way! Check out our sample book page ðŸ‘‡
